----REQUEST TRANSLATOR----

This program is meant to recieve webhooks from Prometheus about alerts and translate them into 
a call to the Statuspage.io API to automatically update about service outages.

To use, set `page_id` variable to be your page id, and replace //auth-code comments with your auth code for the page.
