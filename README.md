This is an api for saving data to local sqlite files. A lot of it is hard-coded so if you wish to use for your own sqlite files you will need to adjust queries in `database.js` to match your data and needs, and honestly you will probably be best off creating your own querying methods in this file and calling them in `server.js`. I may update this repo at some point to have more functionality and more easily configurable.

The server runs on port 3030 by default but you can set it to any port you wish in `server.js` by changing the `port` variable.
